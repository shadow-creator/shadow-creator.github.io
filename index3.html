                <div class="ttwork"><p>This editorial was created for the article, "Why are More Teenagers than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety?" I began by sketching things in pen in my sketchbook and on a scrap piece of paper. However, when I tried to recreate them in illustrator or inDesign, they didn't seem to have as much character. So, I used the scans from my sketches to create my design, as well as my own handwriting where necessary.</p>
